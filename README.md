# Burtonweb Development Site

This is a fairly simple site to get my information out there for potential clients.
I built it off of the free "Creative" Bootstrap theme (from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com)).

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
